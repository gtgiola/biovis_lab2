Lab 2 for Biovisualization

I was unable to create a mac executable for this lab.
If you open the source code with the downloaded data folder it will convert the zoo.data to zoo.csv when you hit run.
To change what file you would like converted line 26 needs to be changed to have the correct url in the loaded strings.
Both the input and output files will be stored in the data folder.
